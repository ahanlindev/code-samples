# Code Samples

This repository is a collection of code samples from past and current projects I have worked on. 

Each folder within this repository represents a project with a local README file describing the project and my role on it. 

Each code sample will have their own README file containing either my remarks on the sample, the documentation of the sample as written for the original project, or a combination of both.

All code, assets, etc. contained with in this repository is either owned by me or replicated here with permission from the owner.
