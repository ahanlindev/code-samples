## About:
Draggin is an in-development arcade-style action game with a survivor-like progression system.

In the game, the player defeats waves of enemies by clicking and dragging their cursor from one spot to another. This creates a rectangular area on screen with corners at the start and end point of the drag. Upon releasing the mouse, all enemies within the area of the box take damage. If this field is hit by an enemy attack before the player releases their mouse, the player takes damage and the attack is cancelled.

Between rounds, the player is able to select upgrades that affect gameplay for the remainder of the run, such as adding a status effect to enemies on hit or increasing the rate at which healing pickups drop.

## Role:
I am the systems architect and lead engineer for Draggin. I have designed and implemented many of the underlying gameplay systems such as:

* Player upgrades
* Enemy wave generation and progression
* Challenges and unlockable content
* Persistent saving and loading

In addition to implementing these systems, I also build development tools for the team to streamline our workflow.
