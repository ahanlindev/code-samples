Engine: Godot

## About:
This game is an in-progress role playing game with a focus on cooperative local multiplayer and novel combat mechanics. 

## Role:
I was brought onto this project as a freelance contractor. The developer of the game requested that I create a debug menu which would allow him to have deeper insight into the state of gameplay during runtime. The result of this contract is the contents of the [Debug Menu](./Debug%20Menu) folder.
